              Welcome to Noor High School ‚Äî a place where hope and learning
              shine bright even in the face of adversity. Founded in 2021, Noor
              High School was born from a dream to create a safe and inclusive
              space where Afghan girls could pursue their right to education
              without fear or limitation. Our school was established in response
              to the growing need for equal educational opportunities for girls
              in Afghanistan. Despite the challenges, we stand firm in our
              belief that every girl deserves access to knowledge, growth, and a
              future filled with possibilities. At Noor High School, we are more
              than just a school ‚Äî we are a symbol of resilience, hope, and the
              power of education.

              critically, dream boldly, and grow confidently. Our goal is to
              empower young women with the knowledge, skills, and values they
              need to shape their own destinies and make meaningful
              contributions to their communities. By investing in girls‚Äô
